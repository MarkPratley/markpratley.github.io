This article shows an easy method for adding R code to a jupyter notebook.

After a brief setup, data is passed from a pandas dataframe to R, plotting it in ggplot, before passing it back again and plotting it using Seaborn.

The Jupyter Notebook can be accessed [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MarkPratley/R-In-Jupyter-Notebook/blob/master/R_In_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb)
