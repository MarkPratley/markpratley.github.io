This article shows an easy method for adding R code to a jupyter notebook.

This is further demonstrated by passing a dataframe from python to R, plotting it in ggplot, before passing it back again and plotting it using Seaborn.

### The Jupyter Notebook can be acessed [here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MarkPratley/R-In-Jupyter-Notebook/blob/master/R_In_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb)
