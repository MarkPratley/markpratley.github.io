For a while these projects languished in an electronic void, occasionally finished often not, so I decided to post them here.

I did this partly in case other people are interested, and partly to encourage me to finish them off, and partly because they seemed sad.

I hope they'll be useful or interesting to someone but if not then at least they have a cosy home.
